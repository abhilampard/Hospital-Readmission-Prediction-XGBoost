Prediction of a readmission for a patient based on the Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. 

This project was done as part of a timed challenge with a time limit of 3 hours to work on this dataset. So, it is just a preliminary model using XGBoost algorithm with some basic data exploration for data processing.
